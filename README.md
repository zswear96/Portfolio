## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is my portfolio that contains three static sites that I used HTML5 to build. One is an Artist's showcase that display's what an Artist's website could look like. Another website is a online bike store that shows the inventory as well as uses bright colors to engage the reader. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to start with templated code and maniplate it. This project really helped me with reading other people's code and understand what is happening.
